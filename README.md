# sentiment_analysis

A sentiment analysis project that incorporates the use of a BERT Model, webscraper, text summarizer, and Google Search Engine.


STEPS:

1) Use a Google Search Engine API to gather information from the web ie) CNN.com
2) Use a webscraper to gather bodies of text from those websites
3) Dump the bodies of text into a knowledge lake
4) Condense the knowledge lake using a text summarizer to highlight relevant information about the topic
5) Use the BERT Model to ask questions about the summarized text
